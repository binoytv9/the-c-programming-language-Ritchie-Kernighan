There may be a situation when we want to maintain an array, 
which can store pointers to an int or char or any

Following is the declaration of an array of pointers to an integer:

int *ptr[MAX];

This declares ptr as an array of MAX integer pointers. 
Thus, each element in ptr, now holds a pointer to an int value. 
Following example makes use of three integers, 
which will be stored in an array of pointers as follows:
